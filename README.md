- In Node.js, `console.log()` is actually:
 `console.log = function (d) {
  process.stdout.write(d + '\n');
};`

- One can use `alt+shift+I` in `VS Code` to have multiple cursors for all the selected elements.  
Usage example: for formatting all the copy-pasted list of words that are not properly formatted as list items for json.
